        Wide World Importers is an importer and wholesaler that supplies products to
        various department stores and supermarkets in the United States. WWI also supplies
        products to other wholesalers. Incidentally, WWI sells products
        directly to consumers. WWI works with a large network of representatives
        who travels to the country to get their products on the market. WWI has ambitions
        to start their activities in Europe from a new headquarters in Amsterdam, so now we have the
