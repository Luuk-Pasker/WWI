    Wide World Importers is an importer and wholesaler that supplies products to
    various department stores and supermarkets in the United States. WWI also supplies
    products to yet other wholesalers. Incidentally, WWI sells products
    directly to consumers. WWI works with a large network of representatives
    who travel the country to get their products on the market. WWI has ambitions
    to start their activities in Europe from a new headquarters in Amsterdam,
    but the shareholders have always stopped the start-up because they are the one
    find great risk to make investments while important customers have fallen over
        fierce competition from online providers.</h4></tekst></div>
